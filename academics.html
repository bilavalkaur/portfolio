        <h1>ACADEMICS</h1>
        <p>Initially, my academic aspirations were firmly rooted in pure sciences. I was captivated by the complexities and wonders of scientific exploration. However, as I approached a pivotal decision in my educational path, I made a last-minute switch to engineering. From the outset, I knew I wanted to delve into a core engineering branch, which led me to explore various fields.<br><br>
        Among the core branches, petroleum engineering initially caught my eye due to its dynamic and impactful nature. As I immersed myself in my studies, my interest naturally transitioned to chemical engineering. The more I learned about the field, the more I fell in love with its vast, diverse, and practical applications. Chemical engineering's ability to solve real-world problems and innovate solutions captivated me.<br><br>
        Now, as a third-year student, my journey in chemical engineering has been nothing short of transformative. I have come to appreciate the field's profound ability to solve real-world problems and drive innovation. Each class, project, and experiment has deepened my understanding and passion for the discipline. Chemical engineering has not only challenged me academically but has also shaped my worldview and aspirations.<br><br>
        I can't imagine my life taking any other path. The decision to pursue chemical engineering has been the most fulfilling choice I've made, and I am excited to continue exploring its potential. I am eager to contribute to the field, leveraging my skills and knowledge to make a meaningful impact.</p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <div class="subsection">
                <h3>Buggy Design</h3>
                <img src="images/buggy.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Successfully designed and implemented an innovative buggy project that showcased both autonomy and obstacle detection capabilities. The buggy navigated a black line track independently, utilizing ultrasonic sensors to identify and halt at obstacles along its path. Leveraging IR sensors, we fine-tuned the buggy's ability to maneuver the track seamlessly. In our final evaluation, the buggy completed two laps and autonomously parked itself at the designated stop, adeptly responding to any encountered obstacles. This was achieved using an Arduino UNO board using Arduino IDE for the programming. This course also required circuit building on PCB board using Eagle software.<br>

                    I achieved an overall A- grade in the course, reflecting not only technical proficiency in the project but also a commitment to excellence and problem-solving.</p>

                <h3>Mangonel Design</h3>
                <img src="images/mangonel.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Engaged in a multidisciplinary project that demanded a fusion of mechanical and electronics expertise. Leveraging skills in Arduino (IDE) and fundamentals of C programming, we embarked on a mission to measure the trajectory range of a mangonel and assess the angular velocity of its throwing arm. <br>
                    For the conclusive assessment, we were tasked with precision throws at specified distances of 25m, 20m, and 15m using the throwing arm. This hands-on evaluation not only tested our project's functionality but also showcased its real-world applicability.</p>

                <h3>Wastewater Treatment Plant Design</h3>
                <img src="#" alt="">
                <p>We designed a wastewater treatment plant for the metallurgy industry, calculating the conent of COD, BOD and other metallic pollutants in the industrial wastewater.<br>
                We calculated the size and capacity of the machinery required for it's treatment after carrying out research on the specific wastewater and assuming certain missing data through hit and trial.</p>

                <h3>Balmer Lawrie & Co. Ltd., Chennai</h3>
                <img src="#" alt="">
                <p>I delved into the intricacies of oil fatliquor, a crucial element in enhancing leather quality. I gained insights into the detrimental effects of natural animal fat on leather's lifespan and quality, and discovered the pivotal role of fatliquor as a substitute for this traditional component while imparting softness to the leather.<br>

                    During this exploration, I specifically focused on Balmol SFL (Synthetic Fat Liquor), an anionic fatliquor crafted from paraffin wax and special esters. Balmol stands out as a light brown to reddish liquid, demonstrating exceptional compatibility with like-charged fatliquors and retanning agents. Its versatility extends to seamless integration with non-ionic products. Noteworthy features include a stable translucent emulsion and a pH range of 6.5-7.5 for its 10% emulsion.</p>
